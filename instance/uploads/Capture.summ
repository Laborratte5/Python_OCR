(CNN) — Joe Biden is in a commanding position as the presidential race enters its final stretch, leading President Donald Trump in polling and fundraising and on offense to expand his pathways to victory while Trump struggles to defend must-win states.
With 24 days until the election and millions of votes already being cast, Biden's aides and Democratic allies say Trump's missteps and the former vice president's message have given him a broad map with numerous paths to 270 electoral votes.
Time is running out for Trump to change the race's trajectory -- and he is failing to capitalize on the opportunities that do exist.

Trump then wasted a day Thursday by calling into a Fox Business morning show and calling Harris a "monster," blaming Gold Star families for his infection with coronavirus and saying he would not participate in his second debate against Biden, which had been scheduled for next week but changed to a virtual format (it was then canceled on Friday).
On Friday, Trump called into right-wing radio host Rush Limbaugh's program for a grievance- filled interview.
Meanwhile, his treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was trying to negotiate an economic stimulus deal with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- a total reversal from Trump's Twitter declaration earlier in the week that he was ending those talks, costing his negotiators days.
With Trump already playing a weak hand, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, at home in Kentucky, cast doubt on the possibility that Republicans would pass any deal in time for the election.
